"""Write the issue template whose board dropdown lists every board (bug_report.yml). Questions go to Discussions
(app 0.4.32), so there is no question template to write any more.

boards.yaml is the one list of boards ESP Screens ships; the issue templates a reporter meets on GitHub named
each board by hand before this, so a new board (tools/ADDING_A_BOARD.md) meant also editing the YAML files
under .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE by hand, easy to forget. This writes the file whole from boards.yaml's own order and
names, the same way tools/generate_board_shapes.py writes screen_manager/app/boards.json. `--check` fails when a
file is out of date, which tools/check.sh runs.

usage: generate_issue_templates.py [--check]
