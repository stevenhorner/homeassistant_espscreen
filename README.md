Thank you! I work on this project with a lot of love, and every bit of support helps. I truly love the Home Assistant community.

**A touch screen for every room that you lay out yourself, and manage from Home Assistant. Incredibly easy to set up and to use.**

**Why.** Your phone is in the other room and a tablet on the wall is expensive. A small ESP32 touch
panel costs a fraction of that, sits on a table or in a wall box, and is always at hand for the
lights, the heating or the vacuum.

**What.** Firmware for affordable panels, five of them today, from the 2.8-inch CYD to the 10.1-inch Guition, with
tiles over up to eight pages, as many per page as the glass holds: lights, climate, blinds and curtains, the vacuum, media, the weather,
history graphs, clocks and timers, your alarm with its keypad, and your cameras on every screen with room for pictures. A tile can take the whole page, one big switch you push without
looking, and a tile can go to another page. An automation can put an alert on every screen when someone rings
the bell, and a screen with room for pictures shows who is there with the doorbell camera's picture. A tap can run any
action Home Assistant has for a tile, and Dark mode suits a screen beside the bed.

**How.** ESP Screen Manager is an app inside Home Assistant. It flashes a new screen over USB, updates
it over Wi-Fi and sends it your tiles. Changing a screen is pick, drag and **Save & send**:
no reflash, no YAML to write, no blueprint, MQTT or token. Brightness, night hours and Dark mode can
also be changed on the screen or by an automation, and your own YAML for one screen survives every update.

## In real life

A Guition in the living room, 37 seconds in one take: tapping tiles, swiping through the pages,
opening cards and a history graph, while the lamp behind it goes from purple to orange.

## Five screens supported, 2.8 to 10.1 inch

One home, five panels. A screen is built for the glass it runs on: it measures its own canvas at boot and gives a page
the cells that board has, six tiles on the 2.8-inch CYD and twenty on the 10.1-inch Guition, while a tile stays about
the same size in millimetres. The same tiles, the same cards, the same editor; the bigger the glass, the more of your
home fits on one page.

Every board works out the same card from its own glass.

A thermostat has its − / + and a bar with a key per mode; an airco shows heat and cool first and the rest behind "…". A live camera on a taller tile fills the card with its picture and its name, or shows the whole picture. Your alarm is a tile in Home Assistant's colours, with a key for every mode and Home Assistant's keypad when the panel asks for a code; someone coming in wakes every screen with the keypad to disarm. A lock locks with one tap and asks for a second one before it unlocks; its card has Open door where the lock can open its latch, and Home Assistant's keypad when the lock asks for a code. A select, such as a washing machine's programme, opens a list with a check at the one it is on. On every screen with the memory for it, every page is built ahead and kept, so the next one is there the moment you turn to it. Rendered from the firmware's own LVGL code with a demo home.</sub></p>

</p>
<p align="center"><sub>The bedside clock takes a whole page: the time as large as the glass allows, with up to three round keys under it for what you reach for at night. A key is a tile in its round form and does what its tile does: the lamp switches with a tap, the front door asks for a second tap before it unlocks, and the alarm shows how it is armed. With Dark mode and the screen's night hours the page is black and the backlight dims. Rendered from the firmware's own LVGL code with a demo home.</sub></p>

- **The editor** follows the language of your Home Assistant profile, so two people in one house each read their own.
- **A screen** carries one language, built into its firmware: change it and press **Update** on the screen (or let
  the nightly round do it). The clock (24 hours or 12 with AM/PM) and the number format change straight away, on
  every screen at once.
- **Words from Home Assistant stay Home Assistant's**: what a door, an airco or a robot says on a tile and in its
  card is the word its own dashboard shows, in your language.

Most languages still need someone who speaks them to read the texts through, and a new language is one file.
[Translating ESP Screens](docs/TRANSLATING.md) walks through both; a language without a file falls back to English
while it keeps your country's clock and numbers.

Each screen links to its page on the [Tessera website](https://tessera-maxgramser.on-forge.com/screens), with what owners report about it.

> **Got your screen working? Tell the next person.** Whether a board is worth buying is something
> only owners can tell. On the website, [My screen works](https://tessera-maxgramser.on-forge.com/community/share?type=installation)
> records your exact board, its firmware version and whether the display, touch and connection work,
> one report per account and board. It takes a minute (you sign in with GitHub), and it is how an

Use these exact board variants: similar-looking product names can have different
controllers or connectors. Wallbox relays are not controlled by default; a 4-inch Guition with relays
can switch them through its Override YAML ([docs/GUITION.md](docs/GUITION.md#relays)).

The one we use ourselves is the 4-inch Guition, and it has been good to us: bright,
responsive touch, and it has been on the wall for months without a hiccup. We buy it here:
[Guition ESP32-S3-4848S040 on AliExpress](https://nl.aliexpress.com/item/1005008506761923.html).
AliExpress being AliExpress, that link may go dead at some point. If it does, search for
"ESP32-S3-4848S040" and check the listing says 480 x 480, ST7701S and a capacitive GT911
touch panel before you order.

ESP Screens builds with its own **ESPHome 2026.9.0**. The firmware also builds in your own ESPHome Device Builder
with ESPHome 2026.6.2 or newer; the 10.1-inch Guition asks for 2026.8.0 or newer, because its touch panel is
newer than that.

The 10.1-inch Guition is **new in this release and has not yet been through our own acceptance test**: its
hardware was worked out and flashed on a real panel, and the screens' own software is the same on every board,
but the two have not stood on one desk together. Tell us how it goes. It needs a panel with pre-v3 silicon
(the boot log says `chip revision: v1.3` or another below v3.0), which is what these panels have shipped with
so far; rev3 silicon needs a firmware of its own.

### Do I need ESPHome?

**You don't need to install the separate ESPHome Device Builder app.**
ESP Screen Manager already includes the ESPHome CLI and can build firmware itself,
install it via USB, put it on a screen plugged into your own computer from the browser, or give
you the file,
and later update it wirelessly over OTA.

**You do need to pair the flashed screen via the ESPHome integration in HA.**
That pairing lives under **Settings → Devices & services**, not in the
App store. Add the discovered device there. If it doesn't appear automatically,
choose **Add integration → ESPHome** and enter the screen's IP address.
If asked for a key, use the `api.encryption.key` from your own device YAML,
and grant the device permission to perform Home Assistant actions.

| Component | Needed? | What for? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ESP Screen Manager app | Yes, for this installation route | Installing firmware, managing tiles, and sending current data to the screen |
| ESPHome Device Builder app | No, optional | Alternative editor and firmware installer; the same CLI is already in ESP Screens |
| ESPHome integration in HA | Yes, pair every screen | The connection between Home Assistant and the physical screen |

So a fresh installation without ESPHome Device Builder also works. If there's
no ESPHome `secrets.yaml` yet, our wizard asks for Wi-Fi once and
stores it locally. Existing Wi-Fi secrets are reused. API and OTA keys
are generated per new screen and stay in that device's own profile.

### Step by step

For Home Assistant Container (Docker) without the App store, follow [Install with Docker](https://tessera-maxgramser.on-forge.com/docs/docker).

For Home Assistant OS with Apps/Add-ons on **aarch64 or amd64**:

1. Open the App store and add this repository:
   `https://github.com/MaxGramser/homeassistant_espscreen`.
2. Install **ESP Screen Manager**, start the app, and open **ESP Screens**.
   ESPHome Device Builder is optional: the ESPHome CLI is already in this app.
3. Connect the screen with a USB data cable to the **Home Assistant machine**
   and choose **New screen** in the sidebar: your board, which way it hangs, a name, the USB port, and
   **Install**. If Wi-Fi is missing from the ESPHome `secrets.yaml`, the window
   asks for it once and ESP Screens only adds the missing lines. The profile
   with unique API and OTA keys goes into the ESPHome folder; the build
   and flash run in the same window (a first build takes a few minutes on a
   Raspberry Pi). Each screen gets its own profile.
   Is Home Assistant on a server or in a virtual machine, out of reach of the screen?
   Plug the screen into your own computer and choose **This computer** under **Install via**:
   ESP Screens builds the firmware and the page puts it on the screen, in Chrome or Edge with
   Home Assistant opened over https. Or choose **Download** and put it on the screen with
   [ESPHome Web](https://web.esphome.io). After that, updates go over Wi-Fi as usual.
4. **CYD:** go through the calibration on the screen. **Guition:** uses GT911
   without resistive calibration. Then pair the discovered ESPHome device in
   **Settings → Devices & services** using the API key the window
   shows after installation (copy button). Grant the device permission to
   perform Home Assistant actions.
5. Select the screen in ESP Screens, choose your tiles, and click
   **Save & send**. Then test the physical controls.

</p>
<p align="center"><sub>New screen (step 3) and choosing your tiles (step 5).</sub></p>

New firmware goes on over Wi-Fi with the **Update** button of a screen in ESP Screens, or by itself
every night if you turn that on under **Settings**; **Firmware & USB → Wi-Fi / OTA** in the sidebar
installs it by hand. For an existing screen, always use the existing profile; creating a new
installation profile generates new keys.
