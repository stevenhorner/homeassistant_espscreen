"""Camera images on a Guition screen (app 0.2.66, firmware 0.2.57).

A screen never asks Home Assistant for a camera itself. This app fetches the snapshot with its own token (a
camera's access token changes every five minutes), makes it exactly as large as the screen shows it and serves
it as an uncompressed 24-bit BMP on its own port on the LAN, where the screen's ESPHome `online_image` loads it.
ESPHome decodes a BMP piece by piece while it downloads; a JPEG of the full screen held the Guition's main loop for
0.6 s (measured 2026-09-17), long enough to lose a tap. On the LAN the larger file costs nothing that matters.

Links are random and short-lived, and only a camera on the screen's layout or in a recent alert gets one. A screen
that loads a link gets the last snapshot at once, however long the camera takes to answer (ESPHome's HTTP client waits
in the screen's main loop, where touch and drawing wait with it), and the load starts fetching the next snapshot.
